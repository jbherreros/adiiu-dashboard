# Football Analytics Dashboard

This dashboard is a web application made with the highcharts javascript library and PHP for the connection with the database (MySQL). Data has been collected from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/top-football-leagues-scorers), although it also uses an external API (https://apifootball.com/) for one of the charts. 

# Installation

First of all, clone this repository in the XAMPP htdocs folder, set up the local server and then import the SQL code from /backend/adiiu-database.sql or just copy & paste it in the console in PhpMyAdmin. 

Now you can visualize the webpage at http://localhost/adiiu-dashboard/.
